Therefore we use session-parallel
mini-batches. First, we create an order for the sessions. Then, we use the first event of the first X
sessions to form the input of the first mini-batch (the desired output is the second events of our active
sessions). The second mini-batch is formed from the second events and so on. If any of the sessions
end, the next available session is put in its place. Sessions are assumed to be independent, thus we
reset the appropriate hidden state when this switch occurs. See Figure 2 for more details.
